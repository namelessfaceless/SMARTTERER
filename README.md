# What is this repository?
This repository is my personal notes trying to work out details of the ARCADE / SMARTT system.
The first of these tasks is working out good notes about the Endpoint. In this repo, you will find:

1. A lot of markdown notes. These will use line by line callouts.
2. Potentially refactored code

Things that have been modified from original SMARTT so far:
1. (nothing!)

This repository will encompass a suite of software packages, the first of which is the OT Emulation Data Broker.

The OT Emulation Data Broker allows simulations to be connected to control system networks.
